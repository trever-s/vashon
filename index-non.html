        <p>You can't drive to the least vaccinated place in America, you have to take a boat.  A fifteen minute ferry ride from Seattle brings you to the town and island of Vashon.</p>
        <p>On paper, the Vashon population skews older, less educated, and overwhelmingly white. In practice, however, Vashon is home to a growing population of urban emigres. They still ride the ferry east to Seattle for work, dealing with the snarled traffic and sprawling corporate campuses. But back home on Vashon, they homeschool their children and feed them a vegan diet of homegrown vegetables. They run an year-round outdoors pre-school – rain or shine. And, at a rate perhaps higher than anywhere else in the United States, they refuse to vaccinate their children.</p>

      <h3>The Power of the Emotional Argument</h3>
      <p>Anti-Vaxxers aren't swayed by the rational, logical argument. They latch on to hearsay, anecdotes, and tenuous correlations. When confronted by logic and evidence, they shift the argument or worse, become increasingly entrenched in their convictions. Of course, this isn't unique to the Anti-Vaxx movement. 9/11 truthers and UFO conspiracy theorists and JFK assassination obsessives all share the same characteristics – an unbending belief in the face of the consensus (ergo conspiratorial) view. They readily accept the claims of dubious and marginalized "experts" because they are ready to believe anyone that agrees with what they <em>feel</em> to be true.</p>

      <p>Emotion will always strike home before fact.</p>

      <p>An infamous study (once disavowed and then confirmed) revealed the effectiveness that face-to-face, empathetic appeals have on changing entrenched opinions: [When Contact Changes Minds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_contact_changes_minds). When it comes to vaccines specifically, researchers found a strong correlation between emotive imagery of ill children and swaying opinion in favor of vaccinations. Humans like to imagine themselves as rational creatures. In truth, we respond first and foremost to our feelings. Only after, do we justify with some "rational" argument.</p>

      <p>Facts alone will not win the day. Science has demonstrated and communicated the facts around vaccination since this argument sparked more than a decade ago. When an entrenched belief is challenged by evidence, we might expect rational people to question those beliefs. Instead, they become entrenched. Piling on evidence has the opposite effect when emotions run high.</p>

      <p>We need to find an emotional argument in favor of what evidence-based medicine has shown us to be true – Vaccines are the greatest medical success story in history. They save countless lives every year. They are safer than any other form of medicine. They are so effective, in fact, that we've forgotten the past seasons spent in fear of polio, measles, and whooping cough. Comfort, as always, breeds complacency.</p>

      <p>Our susceptibility to emotional arguments has assembled a doubtful Trojan horse, filled with secondhand accounts, mother's intuition, and sanctimonious bromides about individual liberty.  Unguarded, these specious arguments worm their way inside. People can't help but compare these salacious, unsubstantiated claims against real, peer-reviewed medicine.</p>

      <h3>This Science Is In. But the Virus of the Myth is Immune.</h3>
      <p>For the first time, our society is confronted by a conspiracy theory that threatens our health.</p>

      <p>Confronted by "new" childhood "epidemics" of autism and Asperger's – complex disorders with an equally complex pathology – desperate parents clamor for a cause and a cure. In this respect, they are no different from their own grandparents, who prayed for a cure to the epidemics crippling their own children.</p>

      <p>But, despite all the fury of our emotions, prayer didn't end polio. Rational, evidence-based medicine did. Vaccines did. We cannot afford to forget the collective relief our grandparents felt. We should see it, we should feel it, and then never forget.</p>
