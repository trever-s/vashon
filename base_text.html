<p>You can&#8217;t drive to the least vaccinated place in America, you have to take a boat. A fifteen minute ferry ride from Seattle brings you to the town and island of Vashon.</p>

<p>On paper, the Vashon population skews older, less educated, and overwhelmingly white. In practice, however, Vashon is home to a growing population of urban émigrés. They still ride the ferry east to Seattle for work, dealing with the snarled traffic and sprawling corporate campuses. But back home on Vashon, they homeschool their children and feed them a vegan diet of homegrown vegetables. They run an year-round outdoors pre-school – rain or shine. And, at a rate perhaps higher than anywhere else in the United States, they refuse to vaccinate their children.</p>

<h3>A QUICK PRIMER ON HOW VACCINES WORK</h3>

<p>Modern vaccines introduce a weakened or dead sample of an infectious pathogen to trigger an immune response in the body. Our body learns to fight an infection by building antibodies in response to the weak invader. Later, when we encounter the full-strength infection, our body is already adapted and can quickly manufacture antibodies to ward off the illness. This is centuries-proven technology, and has eliminated some of the deadliest threats to human health.</p>

<p>So, the contradiction inherent in Vashon&#8217;s Anti-Vaccination culture sparked our curiosity.</p>

<p>How is it that a population of liberal professionals – lawyers, engineers, &amp;c. – stand in such stark contradiction to well-proven science?</p>

<h3>THE CASE AGAINST VACCINES</h3>

<p>Beyond mother&#8217;s intuition and secondhand anecdotes, the core of the Anti-Vaccination argument stems from a 1998 study published in the British medical journal <em>The Lancet</em>. Diagnoses rates for childhood autism steadily climbed in the 1990s, and scientists began examining common environmental factors in children. Some physicians latched on to the idea that vaccines could be at the root of the autism spike.</p>

<p>Even though the author of the study, Andrew Wakefield, was widely discredited for both his methodology and conflicts of interest, the damage was done. Famous parents of autistic children – such as Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey – latched on to the dubious vaccine-autism link. The belief that vaccines caused autism, and even general doubt as to the harmlessness of childhood vaccination, then spread rapidly.</p>

<p>The debate over childhood vaccinations continues today. Most recently, the Center for Disease Control has been accused by the Anti-Vaccination movement of destroying evidence that shows a link between autism and the Measles, Mumps, Rubella vaccination administered to 2-year-olds. A psychologist at the CDC released the original CDC documentation to the public, and Anti-Vaxx amateur epidemiologists have pored over the data to draw their own conclusions. Unsurprisingly, they claim it shows a direct link to autism.</p>

<h3>THE CASE FOR VACCINES</h3>

<p>Outside of Wakefield&#8217;s retracted, disavowed study, no link between vaccines and autism (or any other serious childhood disorder) has been found. The response by Anti-Vaxxers is that any doctor or organization that can&#8217;t find the link is in on a conspiracy to sell vaccines and keep The Truth hidden.</p>

<p>In response to such fears, the CDC and vaccine manufacturers established a compensation fund for anyone harmed by inoculations. The standard for evidence to make a claim is essentially anecdotal. Tell a good story, get a check. At most, 167 claims are filed per year. 167 claims, out of millions and millions of childhood inoculations. It is statistically insignificant.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to remember why we endeavor to vaccinate children at a young age.</p>

<p><strong>QUOTES FROM PRE-VACCINE</strong></p>

<p><strong>PICTURES WITH CAPTIONS</strong> (iron lung, measles, mumps, rubella, &amp;c.)</p>

<p>Prior to widespread inoculations, infant mortality remained high. Even if children survived a communicable childhood disease, they might suffer from the effects long after.</p>

<h3>THE POWER OF THE EMOTIONAL ARGUMENT</h3>

<p>Anti-Vaxxers aren&#8217;t swayed by the rational, logical argument. They latch on to hearsay, anecdotes, and tenuous correlations. When confronted by logic and evidence, they shift the argument or worse, become increasingly entrenched in their convictions. Of course, this isn&#8217;t unique to the Anti-Vaxx movement. 9/11 truthers and UFO conspiracy theorists and JFK assassination obsessives all share the same characteristics – an unbending belief in the face of the consensus (ergo conspiratorial) view. They readily accept the claims of dubious and marginalized &#8220;experts&#8221; because they are ready to believe anyone that agrees with what they <em>feel</em> to be true.</p>

<p>Emotion will always strike home before fact.</p>

<p>An infamous study (once disavowed then ironically confirmed) revealed the effectiveness that face-to-face, empathetic appeals have on changing entrenched opinions: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_contact_changes_minds">When Contact Changes Minds</a>. When it comes to vaccines specifically, researchers found a strong correlation between emotive imagery of ill children and swaying opinion in favor of vaccinations. Humans like to imagine themselves as rational creatures. In truth, we respond first and foremost to our feelings. Only after, do we justify with some &#8220;rational&#8221; argument.</p>

<p>Facts alone will not win the day. Science has demonstrated and communicated the facts around vaccination since this argument sparked more than a decade ago. When an entrenched belief is challenged by evidence, we might expect rational people to question those beliefs. Instead, they become entrenched. Piling on evidence has the opposite effect when emotions run high.</p>

<p>We need to find an emotional argument in favor of what evidence-based medicine has shown us to be true – Vaccines are the greatest medical success story in history. They save countless lives every year. They are safer than any other form of medicine. They are so effective, in fact, that we&#8217;ve forgotten the past seasons spent in fear of polio, measles, and whooping cough. Comfort, as always, breeds complacency.</p>

<p>Our susceptibility to emotional arguments has assembled a doubtful Trojan horse, filled with secondhand accounts, mother&#8217;s intuition, and sanctimonious bromides about individual liberty. Unguarded, these specious arguments worm their way inside. People can&#8217;t help but compare these salacious, unsubstantiated claims against real, peer-reviewed medicine.</p>

<p>For the first time, our society is confronted by a conspiracy theory that threatens our health. If too many people reject vaccinations, the remaining collective immunity will not be strong enough to prevent an outbreak. This principle – herd immunity – is why modern vaccines can be made so weak and consequently, so safe. If an outbreak of measles jumped the water to Vashon, it would immediately spread amongst the unvaccinated children <em>and</em> low-immunity adults.</p>

<p>Confronted by &#8220;new&#8221; childhood &#8220;epidemics&#8221; of autism and Asperger&#8217;s – complex disorders with an equally complex pathology – desperate parents clamor for a cause and a cure. In this respect, they are no different from their own grandparents, who prayed for a cure to the epidemics crippling their own children. </p>

<p>But, despite all the fury of our emotions, prayer didn&#8217;t end polio. Rational, evidence-based medicine did. Vaccines did. We cannot afford to forget the collective relief our grandparents felt. We should see it, we should feel it, and then never forget.</p>
